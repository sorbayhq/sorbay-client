# About
Sorbay is an open source asynchronous video communication tool. It allows you to quickly create and share
screen- and camera recordings. The project consists of two parts: The 
[backend](https://github.com/sorbayhq/sorbay) service to store, organize and share recordings and 
the client (this project) for Windows, macOS and Linux to do the actual recordings.

## Setup

First, clone the repository to your local machine.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/sorbayhq/sorbay-client
cd sorbay-client
```

Next, start the app by running:
```shell
yarn start
```

The app should open and greet you with a login screen. Once you fill in the URL to your 
[backend](https://github.com/sorbayhq/sorbay) service, you should be able to do your first 
recording.

## Binaries
We produce binaries for macOS and Windows but given the state of the project, they are currently a hit-or miss. You can download them 
[here](https://github.com/sorbayhq/sorbay-client/tags).

## Leave a star
Consider leaving a star on the [sorbayhq/sorbay](https://github.com/sorbayhq/sorbay) repository if you think what we are building is 
useful or might be useful at some point. We are in our very early stages and we don't
collect any telemetry. Getting a star is the only viable metric for us to gauge interest.

## State of the project

Sorbay is in its very early stages. Consider it an alpha that shouldn't be running in
production just yet. Our goal was to release Sorbay with a working minimalized featureset
and then add more and more features later on.
