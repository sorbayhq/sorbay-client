# About

Sorbay is an Open Source alternative to Loom. It allows you to quickly create and share
screen- and camera recordings. The project consists of two parts: The [backend](https://github.com/sorbayhq/sorbay)
service to store, organize and share recordings and the client (this project) for Windows, macOS and Linux to do
the actual recordings.

## Setup
If you just want to run the client, download it [here](https://github.com/sorbayhq/sorbay-client/releases). We have
binaries for Windows and macOS. Linux is planned.

## Setup for development

First, clone the repository to your local machine.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/sorbayhq/sorbay-client
cd sorbay-client
```

Next, start the app by running:
```shell
yarn start
```

## State of the project

Sorbay is in its very early stages. Consider it an alpha that shouldn't be running in
production just yet. Our goal was to release Sorbay with a working minimalized featureset
and then add more and more features later on.
