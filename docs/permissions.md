# Permissions

Sorbay records the screen and optionally the camera and microphone once the *record*
button in the app is being hit. The app requires elevated permissions for this to work under macOS.

The first time Sorbay opens, you will get this following window:

And the following windows will pop up:

[Microphone's permission under MacOS](screenshots/macos/microphone_permission.png)

[Camera's permission under MacOS](screenshots/macos/camera_permission.png)

Hit 'OK' on both window permissions.

Then, back to Sorbay, you'll have a *Request* button for the screen's recording permission.
After hitting *Request* on the screen's permission, you should get this pop up:

[Screen's permission under MacOS](screenshots/macos/screen_permission.png)

Click on *Open System Preferences* and allow Sorbay to record your screen.
You should at last, get this final result that looks like this:
